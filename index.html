        <h3>More About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I have always been interested in web development. I was 10 years old when I made my first web page with HTML and CSS.Right now I'm studying in Thakur College Of Engineering and Technology.I took computer science  as my minor subject and was introduced to programming. During my studies I was an active member in student associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects including being a web master. That and my previous interest in web development created a spark to turn my hobby into a career. I took my first steps towards my new career in January 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am talkative and sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.

  <h4>
1. Studying engineering brings prestige
Do not forget the prestige that comes with studying engineering. Non-engineers will be like “wow” when they hear that you are an engineer. Everyone knows how much effort is required to qualify as an engineer. They are also well aware of the sacrifices engineering students have to make during their studies. So the element of respect comes naturally.<br><br><br>

2. It sets you up for professional success
Your entire thought process changes. You learn how to think like an engineer. You acquire logical thinking and critical analysis skills. Decision-making skills are improved. You become more objective and less emotional when it comes to work. All of these skills are greatly needed in the professional world, in any field. So, engineers tend to do better no matter which sector they choose, and they also tend to make good managers. So much so, engineering is the most common undergraduate degree among Fortune 500 CEOs.</h4>
